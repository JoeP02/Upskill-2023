<h1>Upskill 2023</h1>

<h2>What Was Upskill?</h2>

Upskill was a module which I completed in my final year at Teesside University on their Game Development Course.

The goal of the module was to take an exisitng skill of mine and improve upon this or to find a new area I would like to learn and create a prototype.

<h2>What Did I Create?</h2>
I created a basic online multiplayer game where players could connect to each other, using the Online Subsystem and Epic Online Services.

Players are able to create and join sessions which will take them to a lobby. Once all players have connected, the host is able to start the game and all players will be transfered to the game level.
